Title & Abstract:  

> Productive Interpretations: Encouraging Patron Agency through Cultural Criticism  

> This paper builds on work by scholars such as Janice Radway, Benedict Anderson, Wayne Wiegand, and Henry A. Giroux to show how librarians can productively turn to cultural criticism to better comprehend how patrons exert agency within democratic societies. The paper will suggest modes of engagement with faculty students and outreach that encourage investigations of agency, power, subject positions through encouraging patrons’ processes of producing identities and subject positions.  This encouragement of accounting for patrons’ productive interpretive processes allows LIS to recognize a fuller range of the types of agency we support, as well as assist patrons in furthering their critical engagement with relations of power within and beyond library doors.  

Outline (~20 min total):  
 
- [ ] Introduction (2-4 minutes?; overview of what I'll discuss, probably ties to other work so far at conference)  
   - [ ] Probably bring Wiegand into the mix early, either via "To Reposition a Research Agenda: What American Studies Can Teach the LIS Community about the Library in the Life of the User" or something similar?  
- [ ] Present the account of "agency" that I'm working from (7 minutes?)  
   - [ ] Idea of agonistic democracy via Laclau & Mouffe and/or Grossberg   
   - [ ] Account of agency and productivity of subject / identity   
- [ ] Discuss how cultural criticism encourages this sort of agency  
   - [ ] Allows production of the self  
   - [ ] Encourages reflection about larger tendencies / agents within society, how self intersects with those (i.e. agency in Grossberg's account)   
   - [ ] Give examples of Radway, Anderson, Wiegand, Giroux?  
   - [ ] Give example of Samuel Delany?  
- [ ] Cite Burt, Laura. "Vivian Harsh, Adult Education, and the Library's Role as Community Center" as precedent example of how this type of agency has been done within libraries? Perhaps offer this as a counterexample of public space to Habermasian "rationalized discourse in the public sphere," with "community center" form instead focusing on debate (yes, involving logic!) whose role is acknowledged in part as a production of identity. To reiterate, I'm not saying that the community center foregoes rational debate, much less that any given set of library patrons aren't capable of rational discourse. Instead, I'm saying that their debate is not a way of rationalizing away their social identities, but instead part and parcel of forging said identities within larger social discourses.      

That's an awful lot, dude. So maybe decide which parts would be harder to follow aloud & therefore better held off into the proceedings paper? Focus on Giroux & Wiegand (closer to LIS / CAPAL) and bring in Radway?   


Keywords I'll circle around:  

- democracy  
- agency  
- identity  
- libraries  
- fiction  

Maybe I need to use Rancière in this one, to talk about how democracy involves conflict over identities & who "counts" in a decision.

## Intro  

{==slide 1: name, title, affiliation?==}

Today I'll be circling around the ideas of democracy, agency, and identities—in particular, how these intersect with library discourse around works of fiction, not just the non-fiction resources that we normally tout as our contributions to democracy and patron agency. It'll be a somewhat expanded definition of agency—one that acknowledges how our individual selves are embedded within larger structures of power. In this presentation, I'm basically proposing two interventions. One involves expanding the library discourse around our contributions to democracy and society, or how we as a profession envision how what we do intervenes in the larger world. The other intervention is perhaps more pragmatic, and involves how librarians approach displays, programming, or outreach.   



- Anthrogogy, or adult education, not really pedagogy or child education.  

An article that profoundly helped frame the problem for me is Wayne Wiegand's 2003 "To Reposition a Research Agenda: What American Studies can Teach the LIS Community about the Library in the Life of the User." As the title implies, his article suggests that librarian and information studies too often limits its object of study to user behavior in the life of the library, when it might be more productive to instead start with the user's larger frame of reference.

> But failure to include analysis of "library as place" or "reading" questions in its research agenda or its educational curricula prevents the LIS community from adequately understanding the social and cultural preconditions that frame the library's present. An inability to see these deficiencies can be traced to a flawed perspective occasioned by generations of professional library practice where the focus of librarianship (and especially its research focus) has been professionally self-centered and focused by constrained definitions of "information," "learning," and "education." These narrowed perspectives have inevitably led the LIS community to think primarily about the user in the life of the library. (372)   

Thankfully, as I was trying to figure out ways to make this somewhat theoretical and abstract set of concerns more concrete, I came across a lovely article detailing how Vivian Harsh, the director of a Chicago library from the 1930s to 1950s, promoted agency in part by hosting a series of patron-led discussions.  

In Laura Burt's 2009 article "Vivian Harsh, Adult Education, and the Library's Role as Community Center," {==slide 2: Burt 2009 citation==} she explains how Harsh used her library to promote agency among her the predominately African American community of the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. Her years as director began around the time of the Chicago Black Renaissance and continued through much of the Northern Migration years of the 1950s.

Burt's article describes the cultural work done at the Bronzeville library, but doesn't present examples of its content in detail. Of course, what worked in that context would not work in every context. So instead of suggesting that every library mimic the interventions that succeeded under those historical conditions of possibility, let's look at guiding principles that might be able to travel across contexts. Librarians like Maria Accardi, Andrea Baer, James Elmborg, and Barbara Fister have written at length about how the library is a space of learning and pedagogy. Many of these writers invoke critical pedagogy like that developed by Paulo Freire or bell hooks, which is often referred to as "libratory" or "problem-posing" pedagogy.   

A fundamental practice of this style of teaching is that instead of trying to push the truth out at students, a "banking model" in which "learning" mostly consists of amassing these unexamined nuggets of knowledge {==Slide: cartoon 1970s Smaug with jewels?==}, teachers can more productively work with students to address problems together. This works for certain types of content more than for others, of course—if I were to stand up here and talk about highly technical computer programs that require a specific sequence of computer commands, this problem-posing approach would likely miss the mark. But for learners engaging subjects like personal or community identity, ethic studies, issues of social, juridical, or economic oppression, etc.—all of which even young students are likely to have personal experience with—a problem-posing approach seems both prudent and productive.       

Things to add:  


- Maybe mention that Wyoming library that hosted a talk about Islam as a more recent example, in addition to the historical one of Bronzeville's library?  
- Perhaps briefly mention Radway & Anderson, since I'm much more relying on Wiegand & Giroux here (also: explicitly refer to Giroux!)
