## Intro  

{==slide 1: name, title, affiliation?==}

As you know, CAPAL16's theme this year is "Beyond the Library," a chance to situate the discourse of academic librarianship more clearly amid agency, practice, and society. I work in Idaho as an Instruction & Outreach Librarian at a community college. Although I think there are components of education in all aspects of libraries, being an instruction librarian means that I do some of the more overtly academic functions at a library that blurs boundaries between public and academic libraries. So it feels fitting that while preparing today's talk, I've ended up somewhat deemphasizing the thinkers mentioned in the abstract and will spend a bit more time presenting concrete examples from public libraries, examples of what I think libraries can do to discuss or promote patron agency. As we're looking "beyond the library," I want to focus not on academic institutions as the next adjacent frame. Instead, I'm asking us to look at a much larger socio-historical context for how patrons engage with resources libraries provide. Examining this type of context and its local variations in depth would, of course, take far longer than a single presentation allows, so I'll be making some broad gestures rather than truly refined and nuanced delineations.  

{==slide 2: fragments for the overview?==}

In order to do this, I'll present a quick overview of a cultural studies understanding of agency and of cultural criticism, then briefly remind us how this cultural studies approach helps us go beyond the most common ways that library & information studies describes our contributions to patron agency. Finally, I'll talk about those concrete public library examples and suggest how they can guide what we might do in academic libraries as well.  

{==slide 3: cultural studies==}   

A cultural studies understanding of agency—exemplified by Lawrence Grossberg—views agency not just as individual person's capacity to act. Instead, agency expands this conventional and somewhat narrow definition to include an understanding of how powers and potential paths are arranged. Throughout the essays collected in his 1997 _Bringing It All Back Home_ he refers to this spatial conception of agency as "mattering maps," or an awareness of how individual or collective "empowerment is enabled at particular sites and along particular vectors" (367). The potential for empowerment and change is not equally distributed, in other words. Instead of agency meaning a flattened, individualized capacity to decide and to move that is universally applicable to everyone, this view recognizes that there are differences in subject positions and individual talents.   

A first step for a person to gain agency might be to recognize the peculiarities of the terrain and where there are obstacles, easier paths, or places where there are greater potentials for change. And perhaps, another step toward making this distribution of potential more equitable to different subject positions might be realizing that there are indeed differences. These initial steps are where I believe cultural criticism can come in.  

Since at least Raymond Williams, we've known that "culture" is a contested term that sometimes means elite art or literature and sometimes means something more anthropological. For its part, cultural studies is far more interested in social and cultural practices than elite connoisseurship. So in advocating for cultural criticism as a way to promote patron agency, I mean that we can refine ways to help patrons consider a wide variety of social and cultural practices, not attempt to start debates over which books or films belong in a canon.   

Janice Radway provides an example of focusing on cultural practices. The type of "reader response" criticism she pursues looks at how people use the genre fiction that they read. In the case of her 1984 _Reading the Romance_, this means looking at what patrons do with popular, even avowedly "trashy," romance novels. How do readers use pocket paperbacks to structure the rhythm of their day, perhaps reading on their lunch break or on the bus? What meanings do they make out of representations that might not initially seem very empowering? She concludes that although the protagonists of many of these romance novels aren't always laudable female representation, nor do the novels aspire to be more literary than genre fiction. However, the readers she interviews observe how these fictional characters contend with and create space for themselves in often highly patriarchal novelistic worlds and perhaps take lessons or at least inspiration from these characters' choices.   

### Section: Standard Library Discourse & Its Shortcomings around Democracy  

{==present "standard library discourse" & its shortcomings via Buscman and Wiegand==}  

Standard library discourse around democracy both profoundly downplays our contribution to democracy and promotes an understanding of "democracy" that largely ignores cultural practices and subject positions. {==Talk about Buschman & Wiegand here?==} The first few chapters of John Buschman's {==year?==} _$bookTitle_, which focus on {==come back to this==}, shows {==stuff==} (the rest of the book examines classroom technology—an interesting read but not quite pertinent today). Wiegand's {==year?==} "To Reposition a Research Agenda", also seeks to situate libraries within our patrons' larger lived experiences.       

Today I'll be circling around the ideas of democracy, agency, and identities—in particular, how these intersect with library discourse around works of fiction, not just the non-fiction resources that we normally tout as our contributions to democracy and patron agency. It'll be a somewhat expanded definition of agency—one that acknowledges how our individual selves are embedded within larger structures of power. In this presentation, I'm basically proposing two interventions. One involves expanding the library discourse around our contributions to democracy and society, or how we as a profession envision how what we do intervenes in the larger world. The other intervention is perhaps more pragmatic, and involves how librarians approach displays, programming, or outreach.   

### Section: Cultural Criticism  

- concise definition of cultural criticism  
   - culture is an ambivalent and contested term, as Raymond Williams demonstrates in _Keywords_  
   - here I mean "culture" more in the sense of practices and   

- Andragogy, or adult education, not really pedagogy or child education.  

An article that profoundly helped frame the problem for me is Wayne Wiegand's 2003 "To Reposition a Research Agenda: What American Studies can Teach the LIS Community about the Library in the Life of the User." As the title implies, his article suggests that librarian and information studies too often limits its object of study to user behavior in the life of the library, when it might be more productive to instead start with the user's larger frame of reference.   

{++ Add section, with possible quote slide, of bit about next block quote ++}

> But failure to include analysis of "library as place" or "reading" questions in its research agenda or its educational curricula prevents the LIS community from adequately understanding the social and cultural preconditions that frame the library's present. An inability to see these deficiencies can be traced to a flawed perspective occasioned by generations of professional library practice where the focus of librarianship (and especially its research focus) has been professionally self-centered and focused by constrained definitions of "information," "learning," and "education." These narrowed perspectives have inevitably led the LIS community to think primarily about the user in the life of the library. (372)

### Section: Harsh & Montana   

Thankfully, as I was trying to figure out ways to make this somewhat theoretical and abstract set of concerns more concrete, I came across a lovely article detailing how Vivian Harsh, the director of a Chicago library from the 1930s to 1950s, promoted agency in part by hosting a series of patron-led discussions.  

In Laura Burt's 2009 article "Vivian Harsh, Adult Education, and the Library's Role as Community Center," {==slide 2: Burt 2009 citation==} she explains how Harsh used her library to promote agency among her the predominately African American community of the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. Her years as director began around the time of the Chicago Black Renaissance and continued through much of the Northern Migration years of the 1950s.   
       
{++Jump a bunch of explaining what Harsh did++}  

Burt's article describes the cultural work done at the Bronzeville library, but doesn't present examples of its content in detail. Of course, what worked in that context would not work in every context. So instead of suggesting that every library mimic the interventions that succeeded under those historical conditions of possibility, let's look at guiding principles that might be able to travel across contexts. Librarians like Maria Accardi, Andrea Baer, James Elmborg, and Barbara Fister have written at length about how the library is a space of learning and pedagogy. Many of these writers invoke critical pedagogy like that developed by Paulo Freire or bell hooks, which is often referred to as "libratory" or "problem-posing" pedagogy.   

A fundamental practice of this style of teaching is that instead of trying to push the truth out at students, a "banking model" in which "learning" mostly consists of amassing these unexamined nuggets of knowledge {==Slide: cartoon 1970s Smaug with jewels?==}, teachers can more productively work with students to address problems together. This works for certain types of content more than for others, of course—if I were to stand up here and talk about highly technical computer programs that require a specific sequence of computer commands, this problem-posing approach would likely miss the mark. But for learners engaging subjects like personal or community identity, ethic studies, issues of social, juridical, or economic oppression, etc.—all of which even young students are likely to have personal experience with—a problem-posing approach seems both prudent and productive.       

If we're thinking about how we could use this history today, Burt provides the important caveat that Harsh may well have been savvy enough to turn benign neglect into an space of relative cultural freedom. Despite it being Chicago, the whole world was not watching Bronzeville in 1932. Not even the whole of Chicago was closely observing this neighborhood. It may be that even the library system at large was willing not to scrutinize their programming too closely. So what about places where the library operates with more close observation and perhaps more contention?   

A recent example might be familiar to you from an _American Libraries Magazine_ article reporting on the strong pushback that a {==?Montana? ?Wyoming?==} public library experienced when they brought a professor for a talk on Islamic culture.  

{==Slide: Images from the magazine or the library's own site==}

Things to add:  


- Maybe mention that Wyoming library that hosted a talk about Islam as a more recent example, in addition to the historical one of Bronzeville's library?  
- Perhaps briefly mention Radway & Anderson, since I'm much more relying on Wiegand & Giroux here (also: explicitly refer to Giroux!)   
- Maybe mention Buschman and how he deals with democracy / education?  
- WHICH GIROUX? Probably "Schooling and the Culture of Positivism" (and add that Giroux here is not dismissing positivism entirely, but rather a cultural in which aspects of positivism are mistaken for the entirety of ?ethics?, an initially modest method run rampant across a different system of determining values)  

## Newest Version Roadmap   

- [ ] define agency as a cultural studies approach exemplified by Lawrence Grossberg; an understanding of the map of how powers are distributed, a sort of sense of the cultural / economic / social / legal terrain, what moves are available   
- [ ] possibly use Janice Radway's book as an example of how reading fiction helps people gain understandings or use fiction "against the grain"  
- [ ]
