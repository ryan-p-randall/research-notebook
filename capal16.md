Title & Abstract:  

> Productive Interpretations: Encouraging Patron Agency through Cultural Criticism  

> This paper builds on work by scholars such as Janice Radway, Benedict Anderson, Wayne Wiegand, and Henry A. Giroux to show how librarians can productively turn to cultural criticism to better comprehend how patrons exert agency within democratic societies. The paper will suggest modes of engagement with faculty students and outreach that encourage investigations of agency, power, subject positions through encouraging patrons’ processes of producing identities and subject positions.  This encouragement of accounting for patrons’ productive interpretive processes allows LIS to recognize a fuller range of the types of agency we support, as well as assist patrons in furthering their critical engagement with relations of power within and beyond library doors.  

Outline (~20 min total):  
 
- [ ] Introduction (2-4 minutes?; overview of what I'll discuss, probably ties to other work so far at conference)  
   - [ ] Probably bring Wiegand into the mix early, either via "To Reposition a Research Agenda: What American Studies Can Teach the LIS Community about the Library in the Life of the User" or something similar?  
- [ ] Present the account of "agency" that I'm working from (7 minutes?)  
   - [ ] Idea of agonistic democracy via Laclau & Mouffe and/or Grossberg   
   - [ ] Account of agency and productivity of subject / identity   
- [ ] Discuss how cultural criticism encourages this sort of agency  
   - [ ] Allows production of the self  
   - [ ] Encourages reflection about larger tendencies / agents within society, how self intersects with those (i.e. agency in Grossberg's account)   
   - [ ] Give examples of Radway, Anderson, Wiegand, Giroux?  
   - [ ] Give example of Samuel Delany?  
- [ ] Cite Burt, Laura. "Vivian Harsh, Adult Education, and the Library's Role as Community Center" as precedent example of how this type of agency has been done within libraries? Perhaps offer this as a counterexample of public space to Habermasian "rationalized discourse in the public sphere," with "community center" form instead focusing on debate (yes, involving logic!) whose role is acknowledged in part as a production of identity. To reiterate, I'm not saying that the community center foregoes rational debate, much less that any given set of library patrons aren't capable of rational discourse. Instead, I'm saying that their debate is not a way of rationalizing away their social identities, but instead part and parcel of forging said identities within larger social discourses.      

That's an awful lot, dude. So maybe decide which parts would be harder to follow aloud & therefore better held off into the proceedings paper? Focus on Giroux & Wiegand (closer to LIS / CAPAL) and bring in Radway?   


Keywords I'll circle around:  

- democracy  
- agency  
- identity  
- libraries  
- fiction  

Maybe I need to use Rancière in this one, to talk about how democracy involves conflict over identities & who "counts" in a decision.
