<h1>About this Notebook</h1>

<p>This notebook is an attempt to make the humanities research process more open. I'm following the lead of notebooks by people like <a href="http://notebook.jasonheppler.org/notebook/">Jason Heppler</a>, <a href="http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu">W. Caleb McDaniel</a>, <a href="http://notebook.madsenlab.org/labnotebook.html">Mark Madsen</a>, <a href="https://electricarchaeology.ca/2015/10/06/an-elegant-open-notebook/">Shawn Graham</a>, and from the sciences, <a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/lab-notebook.html">Carl Boettiger</a>.</p>

<p>In general, as an instruction librarian who has researched a range of interdisciplinary subjects and taught composition courses, I feel that it'd behoove all of us (as we alternate wearing the hats of scholars, students, researchers, enthusiasts, makers, writers, etc.) to be more open about processes. I've long claimed that libraries have served as the intellectual "maker space" of academies, and this is one way to demonstrate that "maker" process clearly.</p>
