excerpt: I returned to this article repeatedly in library school—probably unsurprising, considering my background in cultural studies & American studies. This is a great intervention in LIS.

## Notes  

From the abstract, Wiegand summarizes his article as saying that library and information studies have only focused on two out of three of the main things American libraries do well. While we tend to research how we make information accessible to people, we overlook research into how people use the spaces we furnish and what they do (intellectually, etc.) as they read the materials we provide. In fact, not only do we overlook these second and third things, we actually do not produce researchers who are well trained to attend to these aspects of library and information use.   

Therefore, Wiegand invites American Studies scholars to study American libraries, even though they have hitherto tended to overlook those civic and cultural institutions.  

(Lots of numbers about use, compared to things like national part attendance, participation in Little League sportsball, etc.)    

Wiegand says that the LIS research community for the last 150 years has:  

> narrowly construed the words "information," "learning," and "education" by constructing definitions based largely on rules set down int he seventeenth century. [….] Over time the LIS community came to regard as most important the kinds of information related to work, or help people become informed citizens, intelligent consumers, and educated people. And from the seventeenth century on these kinds of information were often labeled "useful knowledge." (371)   

(Benjamin Franklin's first order of books for Philadelphia contained zero novels, mostly reference, histories, works of science, etc.)  

> But failure to include analysis of "library as place" or "reading" questions in its research agenda or its educational curricula prevents the LIS community from adequately understanding the social and cultural preconditions that frame the library's present. An inability to see these deficiencies can be traced to a flawed perspective occasioned by generations of professional library practice where the focus of librarianship (and especially its research focus) has been professionally self-centered and focused by constrained definitions of "information," "learning," and "education." These narrowed perspectives have inevitably led the LIS community to think primarily about the user in the life of the library. (372)   

I really appreciate Wiegand's recognition of these failures of analysis. In my English and cultural studies courses, as well as a "history of the book" course led by a historian of books and literacy, questions of "reading" were prioritized. What do readers do when we engage with a text? How do we as individual people relate to the thoughts of another, and how do we do so when we read in groups or when our reading is clearly situated and mediated by cultural forms like the Book of the Month Club publication?   

It seems profoundly strange to me that LIS, a profession much closer to the _spaces_ where these sorts of cultural activities take place, largely chooses to omit them from our training and research in favor of talking about our own techniques (presumably as founded largely on information theory rather than more human-focused social sciences or anthropology). Indeed, perhaps part of the reason for the ubiquitous library school lament that we hear "you need a degree for that?" comes from the fact that too much of our professional publication is so inward-focused that our readership would almost inevitably only be other librarians. For art, literature, music, or other cultural scholarship, an ideal piece of writing might conceivably be taken up equally by a practitioner, patron of the arts, or professor. Yet library writing almost inevitably forecloses our audience to only library workers. With such professional blinders, plus the pressure of publishing for tenure, it's understandable that library and information studies would eventually end up so distorted and maladapted to what seem like our most proximate research areas: our own spaces and the intellectual & physical actions of our patrons.    

(Wiegand turns to Jürgen Habermas's _The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere_ to talk about "place" on p.372)
