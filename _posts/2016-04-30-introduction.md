Just like with [my main site](http://www.ryanpatrickrandall.com), I'll start this off with a song:[^mj]    

[^mj]: The more I think about it, the more I like the tension between Michael Jackson's lyrics and the optimism of starting a new site. Research and making often has an element of tension for me, an edge I can hear some of in this song's post-disco / anxious trouble funk groove.

Here's the beginning of an attempt at an [open humanities research notebook]({{site:url}}/about). I've realized that for posts on [my regular site / blog](http://www.ryanpatrickrandall.com) I feel a need to wrap things up tidily, so I wanted a different space to corral things that are more in-process. I may go back and cherry-pick the reading posts from my "Info Fluxus" blog and add them here retrospectively…we'll see.  

As librarians—and more fundamentally, as thinkers—it would probably behoove us to show the process of thoughts as they grow and evolve. So here's a humble attempt to do that more openly. I hope you'll consider doing something similar.
