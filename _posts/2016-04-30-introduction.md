Here's the beginning of an attempt at an open humanities research notebook. I've realized that for posts on [my regular site / blog](http://www.ryanpatrickrandall.com) I feel a need to wrap things up tidily, so I wanted a different space to corral things that are more in-process. I may go back and cherry-pick the reading posts from my "Info Fluxus" blog and add them here retrospectively…we'll see.  

As librarians—and more fundamentally, as thinkers—it would probably behoove us to show the process of thoughts as they grow and evolve. So here's a humble attempt to do that more openly. I hope you'll consider doing something similar.
